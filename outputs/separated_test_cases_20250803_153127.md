**Step 2:** Enter user credentials
**Step 3:** Submit login form
**Step 4:** Access integration module
**Step 5:** Execute positive test workflow
**Step 6:** Validate system response and capture results
### Test Data (Values Only):

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| username | fallback_user_009@test.com |
| password | FallbackPass9@2024 |
| login_url | https://testapp9.example.com/login |
| browser_type | Chrome |
| browser_version | 118.0 |
| screen_resolution | 1920x1080 |
| environment | Test Environment |
| session_timeout | 30 minutes |
| module_path | Main > Integration > Test Area |
| scenario_type | Positive |
| expected_response_time | < 5 seconds |
| validation_timeout | 60 seconds |
| evidence_types | Screenshot, Log file, Response data |
| test_dataset | FallbackData_Integration_9 |
| execution_mode | Automated |
| cleanup_required | True |
| retry_count | 3 |
| priority_level | Critical |

**Overall Expected Result:** User successfully authenticates and accesses integration module, positive test workflow executes completely without errors, all validation points pass successfully, system response meets performance requirements, comprehensive evidence is captured, and system maintains stability throughout the entire process

**Validation Criteria:**
- Integration requirements fully satisfied
- System maintains stability throughout execution
- Data integrity preserved
- Performance meets standards
- No security vulnerabilities exposed

**Dependencies:** System deployment, Test data configuration, User account setup

**Notes:** Fallback test case with separated steps and data due to parsing error: Insufficient parsed cases
