#### Step 6: Perform comprehensive test cleanup and environment restoration
- **Detailed Action**: Clean up all test data, reset system state, close connections, and restore environment to pre-test condition
- **Action Type**: cleanup
- **Complexity**: high
- **Expected Output**: Test environment is successfully restored to original state with all test artifacts removed
- **Validation Criteria**:
  - Test data removed
  - Original state restored
  - No residual artifacts
- **Test Data**:
```json
{
  "cleanup_operations": [
    "delete_test_data",
    "reset_configurations",
    "close_connections"

  "verification_checks": [
    "data_removed",
    "state_restored",
    "connections_closed"
  ],
  "cleanup_timeout": "120 seconds"
}
```
- **Risks**:
  - Incomplete cleanup
  - Data persistence
  - Environment corruption
