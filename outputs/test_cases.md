Based on the provided documentation, which consists of multiple PDF file structures generated by ReportLab, here are some detailed **test cases** to validate PDF generation, structure, and font embedding. These test cases assume you are testing a PDF generation feature or module.

---

### 1. Basic PDF Structure Validation

**Test Case 1.1: Validate PDF Header**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF file.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the PDF file in a text editor.
  2. Check that the first line is `%PDF-1.3` (or the expected version).
- **Expected Result:** The file starts with `%PDF-1.3`.

**Test Case 1.2: Validate Trailer Section**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF file.
- **Steps:**
  1. Search for the `trailer` keyword.
  2. Ensure the trailer contains `/Size`, `/Root`, `/Info`, and `/ID`.
- **Expected Result:** All trailer keys are present and correctly formatted.

### 2. Object and Page Structure

**Test Case 2.1: Validate Page Count**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF with 3 pages.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the PDF.
  2. Locate the `/Pages` dictionary.
  3. Check the `/Count` value.
- **Expected Result:** `/Count` is `3`.

**Test Case 2.2: Validate Page References**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF with 3 pages.
- **Steps:**
  1. Locate the `/Kids` array in the `/Pages` dictionary.
  2. Confirm it contains 3 references to page objects.
- **Expected Result:** `/Kids` contains three valid object references.

### 3. Font Embedding

**Test Case 3.1: Validate Standard Fonts**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF with text in Helvetica and Helvetica-Bold.
- **Steps:**
  1. Inspect the `/Font` resources in each page.
  2. Check for `/BaseFont /Helvetica` and `/BaseFont /Helvetica-Bold`.
- **Expected Result:** Both fonts are present and correctly referenced.

**Test Case 3.2: Validate Symbol Font Embedding**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF using the Symbol font.
- **Steps:**
  1. Check for `/BaseFont /Symbol` in the font objects.
  2. Ensure it is referenced in the resource dictionary.
- **Expected Result:** Symbol font is embedded and referenced.

### 4. Metadata Validation

**Test Case 4.1: Validate Author Metadata**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF with an author set.
- **Steps:**
  1. Find the `/Author` entry in the `/Info` object.
  2. Confirm the value matches the expected author.
- **Expected Result:** `/Author` is set to `anonymous` (or as specified).

**Test Case 4.2: Validate Creation and Modification Dates**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF.
- **Steps:**
  1. Locate `/CreationDate` and `/ModDate` in the `/Info` object.
  2. Verify that the dates are in the format `D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSS+HH'mm'`.
- **Expected Result:** Dates are present and correctly formatted.

### 5. Compression and Stream Filters

**Test Case 5.1: Validate Stream Compression**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF with content streams.
- **Steps:**
  1. Inspect the `/Filter` entry in the stream objects.
  2. Confirm that `[ /ASCII85Decode /FlateDecode ]` are applied.
- **Expected Result:** Both filters are present in the correct order.

**Test Case 5.2: Validate Stream Length**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF with content.
- **Steps:**
  1. For each stream object, check the `/Length` property.
  2. Ensure the length matches the actual stream data.
- **Expected Result:** `/Length` matches the stream data size.

---

### 6. PDF Navigation and Viewing

**Test Case 6.1: Validate PageMode**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF.
- **Steps:**
  1. Locate the `/PageMode` entry in the catalog object.
  2. Ensure it is set to `/UseNone`.
- **Expected Result:** `/PageMode /UseNone` is present.

---

### 7. Cross-Reference Table Integrity

**Test Case 7.1: Validate xref Table**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF.
- **Steps:**
  1. Locate the `xref` section.
  2. Confirm that all object offsets are correct and reference existing objects.
- **Expected Result:** All xref entries are valid and correct.

---

### 8. Multi-PDF Regression

**Test Case 8.1: Validate Multiple PDF Generation Consistency**
- **Precondition:** Generate several PDFs with different combinations of fonts and pages.
- **Steps:**
  1. Compare the structure and object references between files.
  2. Ensure consistency and correctness in all generated PDFs.
- **Expected Result:** All PDFs follow the expected structure and contain correct references.

---

### 9. Error Handling

**Test Case 9.1: Handle Missing Font Resource**
- **Precondition:** Attempt to use an undefined font.
- **Steps:**
  1. Generate a PDF referencing a font not defined in the `/Font` dictionary.
  2. Open the PDF in a viewer.
- **Expected Result:** PDF viewer displays an error or uses a fallback font; PDF generation logs an appropriate warning/error.

---

### 10. Visual Rendering (Manual/Automated)

**Test Case 10.1: Validate Visual Rendering in PDF Viewer**
- **Precondition:** Generate a PDF with all supported fonts and multiple pages.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the PDF in Adobe Reader and other viewers.
  2. Check that all text is rendered with the correct fonts.
  3. Check page count and navigation.
- **Expected Result:** All text appears correct, fonts are rendered, and navigation works.
