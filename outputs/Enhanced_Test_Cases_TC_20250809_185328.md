So keep checking! We can make everything from large order purchases like shipping out items as soon they're shipped but not later than 5 business days after shipment due.. The rest of the time there's no need anymore!!! Once any product has been processed by us through fulfillment service I'll send them off straight away!! No paperwork required so dont expect anything more expensive!!
