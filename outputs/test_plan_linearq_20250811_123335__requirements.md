Certainly! Below is a structured extraction and analysis based on your instructions, following the Linear Qâ„¢ methodology. Since you have not provided a specific documentation sample, I will use a representative example of a user authentication system for demonstration. If you provide your actual documentation, I can tailor the tables accordingly.

**Ambiguous Requirements Identified:**
- None in this sample; all requirements are explicit and testable.

**Implicit Requirements Identified:**
- REQ-016 (Re-authentication) is implied by security best practices, though not always explicitly stated.

If you provide your actual documentation, I will extract and structure the modules and requirements accordingly, ensuring all entries are complete and formatted as above.
