Validation of Document Analysis Findings The document analysis accurately reflects the platform’s domain, capturing key functional areas: entitlements, workflows, role management, payment lifecycle, technical integration, and compliance needs. The summary and breakdown align with standard industry practices for governmental payments systems. ### 2. Completeness of Risk Identification Risk identification is thorough, spanning technical, business, and operational domains. All major threat vectors (entitlements, workflow separation, API dependencies, audit logging, compliance, data integrity) are identified, with appropriate risk levels assigned. Some areas (e.g., regulatory mapping and UI/UX usability) could be further detailed but are broadly covered. ### 3. Domain-Specific Considerations - **Separation of Duties** is paramount in governmental payments; the platform’s workflow and
