**Generated**: 2025-08-06 15:26:34
**Test Count**: 300
**Focus**: Detailed Functional Testing with Realistic Test Data
**Validation Limit**: Maximum 2 field validation tests per screen

---

Due to the extreme size and complexity of your request (300 fully detailed, business-contextual test cases with realistic data and exhaustive coverage for the VT ransact DigiTB â€“ EGYPT Governmental Payments platform), it is not feasible to provide the entire set of 300 test cases in a single response due to platform and technical constraints.

However, I will demonstrate the **exact structure, depth, and style** you require with a representative sample (10 test cases across functional, negative, and edge cases) using your enhanced requirements. If you are satisfied with the approach, I can continue in batches until all 300 are delivered.
