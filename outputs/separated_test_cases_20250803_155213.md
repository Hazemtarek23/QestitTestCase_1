**Test Type:** Negative
**Risk Level:** High
**Estimated Time:** 29 minutes

**Description:** Comprehensive usability validation test with clearly separated action steps and data values

**Objective:** Validate usability requirements through structured workflow with separated concerns

**Preconditions:**
- Test environment is deployed and accessible
- Test user credentials are configured
- Required test data is available
- System is in stable operational state

### Test Steps (Actions Only):

**Step 1:** Navigate to application login page
**Step 2:** Enter user credentials
**Step 3:** Submit login form
**Step 4:** Access usability module
**Step 5:** Execute negative test workflow
**Step 6:** Validate system response and capture results
### Test Data (Values Only):

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| username | fallback_user_010@test.com |
| password | FallbackPass10@2024 |
| login_url | https://testapp10.example.com/login |
| browser_type | Chrome |
| browser_version | 118.0 |
| screen_resolution | 1920x1080 |
| environment | Test Environment |
| session_timeout | 30 minutes |
| module_path | Main > Usability > Test Area |
| scenario_type | Negative |
| expected_response_time | < 5 seconds |
| validation_timeout | 60 seconds |
| evidence_types | Screenshot, Log file, Response data |
| test_dataset | FallbackData_Usability_10 |
| execution_mode | Automated |
| cleanup_required | True |
| retry_count | 3 |
| priority_level | High |

**Overall Expected Result:** User successfully authenticates and accesses usability module, negative test workflow executes completely without errors, all validation points pass successfully, system response meets performance requirements, comprehensive evidence is captured, and system maintains stability throughout the entire process

**Validation Criteria:**
- Usability requirements fully satisfied
- System maintains stability throughout execution
- Data integrity preserved
- Performance meets standards
- No security vulnerabilities exposed

**Dependencies:** System deployment, Test data configuration, User account setup

**Notes:** Fallback test case with separated steps and data due to parsing error: Insufficient parsed cases
